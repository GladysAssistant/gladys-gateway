# Gladys Gateway

The Gladys Gateway is an end-to-end encrypted gateway between your local Gladys installation (your Raspberry Pi at home for example), and you on the internet.

When you are away from home, it becomes easier with the Gladys Gateway to control your home without having to open any ports on your internet box.
